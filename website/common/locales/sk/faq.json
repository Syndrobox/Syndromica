    "webFaqAnswer1": "* Dobré Návyky (tie s :heavy_plus_sign:) sú úlohy, ktoré môžeš robiť mnoho krát za deň, napríklad jesť zeleninu. Zlé Návyky (tie s :heavy_minus_sign:) sú úlohy, ktorým by si sa mal/a vyhýbať, napríklad hryzenie si nechtov. Návyky s :heavy_plus_sign: aj :heavy_minus_sign: majú na výber dobrú voľbu a zlú voľbu, ako napríklad ísť po schodoch vs. zobrať si výťah. Dobré Návyky odmeňujú skúsenosťami a zlatom. Zlé Návyky odoberajú zo zdravia.\n* Denné úlohy sú úlohy, ktoré musíš robiť každý deň, ako napríklad umývanie si zubov alebo kontrola svojho emailu. Môžeš si nastaviť v ktoré dni je potrebné vykonať Dennú úlohu kliknutím na ňu, aby si ju upravil/a. Ak preskočíš Dennú úlohu, ktorú si mal/a vykonať, tvoja postava dostane cez noc zranená. Dávaj si pozor, aby si si nepridal/a príliš veľa Denných úloh naraz!\n* Úlohy sú tvoje klasické naplánované úlohy. Ich dokončením získavaš zlato a skúsenosti. Nikdy nestratíš zdravie za nesplnenie Úlohy. Môžeš pridať deadline na splnenie úlohy tak, že na ňu ťukneš.",
    "webFaqAnswer3": "Your tasks change color based on how well you are currently accomplishing them! Each new task starts out as a neutral yellow. Perform Dailies or positive Habits more frequently and they move toward blue. Miss a Daily or give in to a bad Habit and the task moves toward red. The redder a task, the more rewards it will give you, but if it’s a Daily or bad Habit, the more it will hurt you! This helps motivate you to complete the tasks that are giving you trouble.",
    "webFaqAnswer5": "The best way is to invite them to a Party with you by clicking \"Party\" in the navigation bar! Parties can go on quests, battle monsters, and cast skills to support each other. You can also join Guilds together (click on \"Guilds\" in the navigation bar). Guilds are chat rooms focusing on a shared interest or the pursuit of a common goal, and can be public or private. You can join as many Guilds as you'd like, but only one Party. For more detailed info, check out the wiki pages on [Parties](http://syndromica.fandom.com/wiki/Party) and [Guilds](http://syndromica.fandom.com/wiki/Guilds).",
    "webFaqAnswer7": "At level 10, you can choose to become a Warrior, Mage, Rogue, or Healer. (All players start as Warriors by default.) Each Class has different equipment options, different Skills that they can cast after level 11, and different advantages. Warriors can easily damage Bosses, withstand more damage from their tasks, and help make their party tougher. Mages can also easily damage Bosses, as well as level up quickly and restore Mana for their party. Rogues earn the most Gold and find the most item drops, and they can help their party do the same. Finally, Healers can heal themselves and their party members. If you don't want to choose a Class immediately -- for example, if you are still working to buy all the gear of your current class -- you can click \"Opt Out\" and re-enable it later under Settings.",
    "webFaqAnswer9": "First, you need to join or start a Party by clicking \"Party\" in the navigation bar. Although you can battle monsters alone, we recommend playing in a group, because this will make quests much easier. Plus, having a friend to cheer you on as you accomplish your tasks is very motivating! Next, you need a Quest Scroll, which are stored under Inventory > Quests. There are four ways to get a scroll:\n * When you invite people to your Party, you'll be rewarded with the Basi-List Scroll!\n * At level 15, you get a Quest-line, i.e., three linked quests. More Quest-lines unlock at levels 30, 40, and 60 respectively.\n * You can buy Quests from the Quests Shop (Shops > Quests) for Gold and Gems.\n * When you check in to syndromica a certain number of times, you'll be rewarded with Quest Scrolls. You earn a Scroll during your 1st, 7th, 22nd, and 40th check-ins.\n To battle the Boss or collect items for a Collection Quest, simply complete your tasks normally, and they will be tallied into damage overnight. (Reloading may be required to see the Boss's Health bar go down.) If you are fighting a Boss and you missed any Dailies, the Boss will damage your Party at the same time that you damage the Boss. After level 11 Mages and Warriors will gain Skills that allow them to deal additional damage to the Boss, so these are excellent classes to choose at level 10 if you want to be a heavy hitter.",
